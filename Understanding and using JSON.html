<h1>Understanding JSON</h1>

<h2>What Is JSON?</h2>
<p>JavaScript Object Notation is a file format for storing and interchanging data 
    that was designed to be lightweight, easy for both humans and computers to 
    read, and be language independent. As its name suggests, JSON is derived from 
    the JavaScript syntax for creating arrays and objects, but has not always been 
    100% valid JavaScript due to some unicode character encoding differences.
</p>
<h2>How JSON Works</h2>
<p>
    JSON uses curly brackets { } to represent objects, and square brackets [] to 
    represent arrays (lists of data). Either of these can be empty or contain any 
    number data entries supported in JSON. Supported data types include numbers, 
    strings (characters between double quotes ""), Boolean values (true or false), 
    nested objects or arrays, or the value null.
</p>

<h2>Using JSON in JavaScript</h2>
<p>You can create ad hoc data types in JavaScript with JSON syntax:</p>
<code>
    const bob = {
        "name": "Bob",
        "age": 43,
        "allergies": [
            "peanut oil",
            "watermelon",
            "bee stings"
        ]
        "address": {
            "streetAddress": "111 11th Street",
            "city": "Greenville",
            "state": "NC",
            "postalCode": "27858"
        }
        "is married": false,
        "spouse": null
    }

    console.log(bob["allergies"][1])  // prints out 'watermelon'
</code>
