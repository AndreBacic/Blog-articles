<h1>Making Web APIs in C#</h1>

<h2>What Is a Web API?</h2>
<p>
    Firstly, an API (Application Programming Interface) is just software that 
    allows two other programs to communicate with each other. Thus, a *Web* API 
    is a program that allows two apps to share data over the internet. These apps 
    may be the front and back ends of a website, but can really run anywhere on the internet.

<h2>Why Use a Web API? Why Not MVC or Another Architecture?</h2>
<p>
    There are many design patterns, each with their own pros and cons, but the 
    beauty of a Web API is that it cleanly separates the front and back ends of 
    a full-stack web app, such that either could easily be scrapped and replaced 
    with totally different software written in a different language without having 
    to change the other. For example, this blog has a C# + SQL Server back end 
    and a vanilla JavaScript + vanilla CSS front end. The entire front end could 
    be re-built with a C# Blazor WAsm app, and the server-side code would require 
    zero changes. Alternatively, this blog's back end could be used by a mobile 
    app (written perhaps in Swift or Kotlin), or by a desktop program (like a C# 
    WinForms app or a Flutter project), or by all of the above at once.

<h2>How to Program a Web API in C#</h2>
<p>
    - Visual Studio template
    - Analyzing the template web API
    - Changing the template
</p>
<p>First, let's open Visual Studio (version 2017 or higher should be compatible).
    Select Create a new Project and then find the ASP.NET Core Web API project template.</p>

<h2>How to Consume the C# Web API with JavaScript</h2>
<p>
    - Creating a wwwroot folder
    - html page + a little CSS
    - JavaScript fetch API
    - Looking at the finished project
