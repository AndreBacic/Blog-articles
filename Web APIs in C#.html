<h1>Making Web APIs in C#</h1>

<h2>What Is a Web API?</h2>
<p>
    Firstly, an API (Application Programming Interface) is just software that 
    allows two other programs to communicate with each other. Thus, a *Web* API 
    is a program that allows two apps to share data over the internet. These apps 
    may be the front and back ends of a website, but can really run anywhere on the internet.
</p>

<h2>Why Use a Web API? Why Not MVC or Another Architecture?</h2>
<p>
    There are many design patterns, each with their own pros and cons, but the 
    beauty of a Web API is that it cleanly separates the front and back ends of 
    a full-stack web app, such that either could easily be scrapped and replaced 
    with totally different software written in a different language without having 
    to change the other. For example, this blog has a C# + SQL Server back end 
    and a vanilla JavaScript + vanilla CSS front end. The entire front end could 
    be re-built with a C# Blazor WAsm app, and the server-side code would require 
    zero changes. Alternatively, this blog's back end could be used by a mobile 
    app (written perhaps in Swift or Kotlin), or by a desktop program (like a C# 
    WinForms app or a Flutter project), or by all of the above at once.
</p>

<h2>How to Program a Web API in C#</h2>
<p>
    - Visual Studio template
    - Analyzing the template web API
    - Changing the template
</p>
<p>
    First, let's open Visual Studio (I'm using VS 2019 but the steps are very similar for other recent versions).
    Select Create a new Project and then find the ASP.NET Core Web API project template.
</p>
<img src="https://andreblog.azurewebsites.net/images/CreateNewWebAPI" alt="Selecting the C# Web API template">
<p>
    Click 'Next' and give the new project a descriptive name (like FirstWebAPIProject) 
    and choose the folder where you want it to be. Click 'Next' and observe that VS 
    automatically selects the most recent version of .NET you have installed. Leave 
    all of the default values for this example and click 'Create' to generate the new project.
</p>
<p>
    Once the code generator has finished scaffolding out the new Web API project, observe 
    in the Solution Explorer tab the codebase structure. Program.cs is just boilerplate code 
    for starting and running all of the other code. Startup.cs contains the code for configuring
    the API, and is where you would write code to define authentication and authorization 
    policies or add different services to dependency injection. The appsettings.json file 
    stores additional configuration data.
</p>
<p>
    The more interesting code is in the WeatherForecast.cs and Controllers/WeatherForecastController.cs 
    files. The WeatherForecast data model expectedly has a few properties for storing data about what 
    the weather was at a specific time. In the WeatherForecastController we see a single RESTful API 
    endpoint that returns a list of randomly filled out WeatherForecasts.

<h2>How to Consume the C# Web API with JavaScript</h2>
<p>
    - Creating a wwwroot folder
    - html page + a little CSS
    - JavaScript fetch API
    - Looking at the finished project
