<h1>Top 3 Responsive CSS Techniques</h1>

<h2>What Is Responsive CSS and Why Do We Need It?</h2>
<p>
    Responsive web design is coding a site's HTML and CSS to be user-friendly and look good on any device. 
    People today browse the web on screens from phones 3 inches (7.5cm) wide to desktop monitors spanning multiple 
    feet (0.5 - 1m), and each size of screen demands a different layout. In this article we'll explore three 
    methods for writing CSS that will arrange your website to impress your users and improve their experience, 
    regardless of their chosen device.
</p>

<h2>HTML Setup</h2>
<p>
    Firstly, the website's HTML files each need to include a link to the CSS file so the browser can apply 
    the styles, and a meta tag to make measurements the same across all devices:
</p>
<code>&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"&gt;</code>
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
</code>
<p>
    According to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag">Mozilla</a>, 
    devices with smaller screen widths by default render website pages first in a larger virtual viewport, and then 
    shrink the result to fit the screen (for example, a phone that is 360 pixels wide may render a webpage 
    in a 720 pixel virtual viewport and then reduce the webpage to half the size). This means that responsive 
    CSS that would otherwise rearrange content to fit the screen is ignored, because the CSS code thinks that 
    the screen is much wider than it really is. Adding the meta tag to the head of the HTML file tells the 
    device to render the page at the actual size of the screen, and thus CSS rules will apply as expected.

    Let's now look at our responsive CSS techniques, starting with:
</p>
<h2>Responsive Units</h2>
<p>
    While some CSS units (like px, mm, or pt) are fixed, others are relative to the size of the viewport 
    or containing element:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>1<em>vw</em> equals 1% of the browser viewport's width</li>
    <li>1<em>vh</em> equals 1% of the browser viewport's height</li>
    <li>1<em>vmin</em> equals 1% of the smaller of the browser viewport's width and height</li>
    <li>1<em>vmax</em> equals 1% of the larger of the browser viewport's width and height</li>
    <li>1<em>%</em> equals 1% of the size of the parent element</li>
</ul>
<p>
    For example, the following code styles a parent container to fill the whole viewport and child elements 
    to each be a quarter of the parent's width:
</p>
<code>/* CSS code */
.parent {
    width: 100vw;
    min-height: 100vh;
}
.child {
    width: 25%;
}
</code>
<p>HTML:</p>
<code>&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="parent"&gt;
        &lt;p class="child"&gt;Child element1&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="child"&gt;Child element2&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="child"&gt;Child element3&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p class="child"&gt;Child element4&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code>

<h2>Media Queries</h2>
<p>While responsive units help websites adjust to the browser window, often the page layout can't simply be shrunk 
    or stretched. Instead, the larger or smaller screens demand a totally different layout, but CSS rules defined in 
    media queries make this surprisingly easy.
