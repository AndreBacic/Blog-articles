<h1>Accessing MongoDB with C#</h1>

<h2>Why use MongoDB with C#?</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1px;">
    MongoDB is a database designed to help apps read humongous amounts of data at top speed. 
    Unlike relational (SQL) databases, MongoDB is a document-oriented database, meaning that 
    all data is stored as JSON-style key-value pairs (where the values can be nested documents
    or arrays of nested documents). Because complex data structures can be stored 
    as single documents, MongoDB doesn't have to perform any joins when reading data and can 
    provide a much faster query response time.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1px;">
    Additionally, the documents in MongoDB collections (MongoDB has collections instead of tables) 
    do not have to follow a rigidly-defined schema, so the data structures stored in MongoDB 
    collections can be easily changed without the need for database migrations. In fact, documents 
    in MongoDB collections can be store totally different data, if need be.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1px;">
    When your in-production app needs to scale for the increasing number of users, MongoDB makes 
    it easy to scale horizontally with a technique called sharding. While sharding is possible 
    with SQL databases (using entity-based sharding), the fact that data structures are spread out 
    across many tables makes it a very complicated endeavor. Thus, SQL databases are usually scaled
    vertically, with a single server being upgraded to a better CPU and more RAM. But with document-oriented databases, 
    few if any links between collections exist, which makes splitting the database into several shards,
    one on each cheaper server, a much simpler task.
</p>
<p>
    Even though C# is known for great integrations with SQL databases, it has an excellent 
    library for accessing MongoDB. The MongoDB.Driver package provides all the functionality 
    necessary to develop awesome apps with MongoDB.

<h2>What drawbacks come from using a document-oriented database?</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1px;">
    While MongoDB does support simple links between collections, it does not support joins. 
    If your software involves graphs of relationships between objects (like an issue tracker
    where many organizations have many workers who collaborate on many projects, each of which
    has many workers and perhaps many sub-projects with many more workers), a document-oriented 
    database will not be able to support the complexity of the graph. MongoDB shines in situations 
    where the graph of a stored data structure doesn't have any cycles, like a tree or linked list. 
</p>
<p>
    Also, because an entire document must be updated to change a value, applications 
    that have a high update rate, but do not need maximum read performance, may be better served 
    by a different paradigm of database design.
