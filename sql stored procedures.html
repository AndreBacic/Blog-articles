<h1>Stored Procedures in MS SQL Server</h1>

<h2>What Are Stored Procedures?</h2>
<p>
    Stored procedures are groups of SQL statements that are executed as a single unit. 
    From the perspective of a developer who does not specialize in database management, 
    stored procedures are the SQL equivalent of functions/methods. They can be called 
    (AKA executed) with or without parameters, and can return values.
</p>
<p>
    There are many benefits from using stored procedures, including:
    - Efficiency: SQL Server caches the plan for executing a stored procedure 
        after running it the first time, yielding a significant performance boost.
    - Security: Not only can stored procedures be used to define user access limits,
        but because input parameters are not treated as SQL statements, it is very 
        difficult for hackers to make SQL injection attacks.
    - Code reuse: Just as isolating code in other languages in functions lets it be called 
        in many parts of an application, so can stored procedures be implemented to eliminate 
        redundancy.
    - Maintenance: By writing SQL code in stored procedures instead of in strings in 
        an application's code, it cleanly separates the database-specific code from the 
        rest of the application. This makes it easier and safer to test or change both 
        the database and backend code.

<h2>How to Create a Stored Procedure (With SQL Server Syntax)</h2>
<p>A procedure with no parameters:</p>
<code>
-- Create a stored procedure and give it a name
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.spExampleProcedure
AS   -- The code before the AS is the stored procedure's header, and after the AS is the body, where  SQL statements are executed.
BEGIN
    -- Insert code here
    -- Example:
    SELECT * FROM dbo.MyTable;   -- SELECT statements will return data from the procedure, as will some other SQL statements.
END

-- By the way, a -- is SQL syntax for a comment.
</code>
<p>You can pass as many parameters to a stored procedure as you'd like:</p>
<code>
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.spExampleProcedure
(
    -- Define each parameter by specifying its name and data type:
    @param1 int,     -- Don't forget the @ before the name or to put commas between parameters
    @param2 NVARCHAR(50),
    @param3 DATETIME
)
AS
BEGIN
    -- Insert code here
    -- Example:
    INSERT into dbo.MyTable (param1, param2, param3);
END
</code>

<h2>How to Change an Existing Stored Procedure</h2>
<p>Making changes to an existing stored procedure is simple:</p>
<code>ALTER PROCEDURE dbo.spExampleProcedure
    -- Write the new code for the stored procedure here
</code>
<p>
    In SSMS (Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio), you can generate an alter 
    procedure script with all of the existing procedure code already filled in 
    by right-clicking the procedure and selecting "Modify":

    In summary, you've learned what stored procedures are and how to 
    create, execute, and alter them in Microsoft SQL Server. See if 
    you can use stored procedures to make your database code even better!
