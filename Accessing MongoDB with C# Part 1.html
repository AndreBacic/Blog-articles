<h1>Accessing MongoDB With C# Part 1: Introduction and Configuration</h1>

<h2>Why Use MongoDB With C#?</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1px;">
    MongoDB is a database designed to help apps read humongous amounts of data at top speed. 
    Unlike relational (SQL) databases, MongoDB is a document-oriented database, meaning that 
    all data is stored as JSON-like key-value pairs called documents. In MongoDB, documents 
    are stored as BSON (Binary JSON). The values of documents can be 
    standard data types like number, string and boolean, or they can be arrays, nested documents
    (AKA objects) or arrays of nested objects. Because complex data structures can be stored 
    as single documents, MongoDB doesn't have to perform any joins when reading data and can 
    provide a much faster query response time.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1px;">
    Additionally, the documents in MongoDB collections (MongoDB has collections instead of tables) 
    do not have to follow a rigidly-defined schema, so the data structures stored in MongoDB 
    collections can be easily changed without the need for database migrations. In fact, documents 
    in MongoDB collections can be store totally different data, if need be.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1px;">
    When your in-production app needs to scale for the increasing number of users, MongoDB makes 
    it easy to scale horizontally with a technique called sharding. While sharding is possible 
    with SQL databases (using entity-based sharding), the fact that data structures are spread out 
    across many tables makes it a very complicated endeavor. Thus, SQL databases are usually scaled
    vertically, with a single server being upgraded to a better CPU and more RAM. But with document-oriented databases, 
    few if any links between collections exist, which makes splitting the database into several shards,
    one on each cheaper server, a much simpler task.
</p>
<p>
    Even though C# is known for great integrations with SQL databases, it has an excellent 
    library for accessing MongoDB. The MongoDB.Driver package provides all the functionality 
    necessary to develop awesome apps with MongoDB.
</p>

<h2>What drawbacks come from using a document-oriented database?</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1px;">
    While <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/">MongoDB supports joins,</a> 
    it is not best suited for software that involves complicated graphs of relationships between objects 
    (like an issue tracker where many organizations have many workers who collaborate on many projects, 
    each of which has many workers and perhaps many sub-projects with many more workers). MongoDB shines 
    in situations where the graph of a stored data structure doesn't have any cycles, like a tree or linked list. 
</p>
<p>
    Also, because updating data often requires changing deeply nested data, applications 
    that have a high update rate, but do not need maximum read performance, may achieve better
    performance with a different paradigm of database design.
</p>

<h2>Setting Up a C# Project With MongoDB</h2>
<p>
    To demonstrate adding MongoDB to a C# project, we'll update the C# web API from the 
    <a href="https://andreblog.azurewebsites.net/article.html?7">Making a Web App with a C# Web API</a> 
    article. In the previous article, we created a C# web API that could generate random weather 
    data and display it to a user, but it couldn't store the data permanently in a database. Once 
    we add MongoDB to the app, the weather reports served to the front end will come from permanent 
    records and not be randomly generated.
</p>
<p>
    After either setting up an account with MongoDB Atlas or installing MongoDB locally (I'm using 
    MongoDB locally), we'll create a new database with an initial collection named "Weather Forecasts" 
    (all MongoDB databases are required to have at least one collection):
</p>

    style="margin: 0 auto 1rem; width: min(100%, 36rem);">
<p>
    Next, in Visual Studio, right click on the project's Dependencies folder and select Manage 
    NuGet Packages. In the NuGet Manager, browse for the MongoDB.Driver package and click Install. 
    Now that this package is added to the project, we can create a new folder named 'DataAccess' 
    and add a new class for data access called MongoDBAccessor to it (change the root of the namespace 
    to whatever your project is named):
</p>
<code>using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using MongoDB.Bson;
using MongoDB.Driver;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

namespace WebAPIDemoForArticle.DataAccess
{
    public class MongoDBAccessor
    {
        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// The link to the MongoDB database
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;
        private readonly IMongoDatabase _database;
        private const string _forecastCollection = "Weather Forecasts";
        
        public MongoDBAccessor(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            MongoClient client = new MongoClient();
            string database = configuration.GetConnectionString("MongoDB");
            _database = client.GetDatabase(database);
        }
        
        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// Runs a query to get all the binary JSON (BSON) documents in the "Weather Forecasts" collection,
        /// using MongoDB's Find() method.
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;
        public List&lt;WeatherForecast&gt; GetForecasts() {
            IMongoCollection&lt;WeatherForecast&gt; collection = _database.GetCollection&lt;WeatherForecast&gt;(_forecastCollection);
            return collection.Find(new BsonDocument()).ToList();
        }
    }
}
</code>
<p>
    You'll notice that the constructor of the MongoDBAccessor class takes an IConfiguration object, 
    which is a type that represents the application's configuration settings and will be passed in 
    by the ASP.NET Core dependency injection system. However, the configuration does not currently 
    contain any connection strings for MongoDB. To add a connection string, you'll need to add a 
    the following code to the appsettings.json file (because I'm using a local MongoDB instance,
    the connection string is simply the name of the database):
</p>
<code>  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "MongoDB": "DemoDB"
  },
</code>
<p>
    Speaking of dependency injection, we'll need to add a new dependency to the project's 
    startup code. In .NET 6.0 or later, you can add a new Singleton dependency in the Program.cs file:
</p>
<code>builder.Services.AddControllers();
builder.Services.AddEndpointsApiExplorer();
builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();
<strong>builder.Services.AddSingleton&lt;MongoDBAccessor&gt;();</strong>
</code>
<p>
    In .NET 5.0 or earlier, you'll need to add a new Singleton in the Startup.cs file, at  
    the end of Startup.ConfigureServices():
</p>
<code>public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddControllers();
    services.AddSwaggerGen(c =>
    {
        c.SwaggerDoc("v1", new OpenApiInfo { Title = "WebAPIDemoForArticle", Version = "v1" });
    });
    <strong>services.AddSingleton&lt;MongoDBAccessor&gt;();</strong>
}
</code>
<p>
    The last step before changing the API controller to use the MongoDB accessor is to update the 
    WeatherForecast class to be properly serialized and deserialized to and from BSON. Firstly, the 
    class needs a Guid Id property that MongoDB will use as the unique identifier for each document. Next, the 
    WeatherForecast class has a property called TemperatureF that simply converts the TemperatureC property to 
    Fahrenheit, and doesn't store any data. The TemperatureF property can be marked to be ignored when serializing
    by adding the [BsonIgnore] attribute to the property:
</p>
<code><strong>using MongoDB.Bson.Serialization.Attributes;</strong>
using System;

namespace WebAPIDemoForArticle
{
    public class WeatherForecast
    {
        <strong>[BsonId]</strong>
        <strong>public Guid Id { get; set; }</strong>

        public DateTime Date { get; set; }

        public int TemperatureC { get; set; }
        
        <strong>[BsonIgnore]</strong>
        public int TemperatureF => 32 + (int)(TemperatureC / 0.5556);

        public string Summary { get; set; }
    }
}
</code>
    
<h2>Running MongoDB Queries with C#</h2>
<p>
    Finally, we can update the API controller to use the MongoDBAccessor class to query forecasts 
    from the database instead of making them up on the fly. We'll need to add a dependency to the 
    controller's constructor and edit the controller's Get() method to use the MongoDBAccessor:
</p>
<code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using WebAPIDemoForArticle.DataAccess;

namespace WebAPIDemoForArticle.Controllers
{
    [ApiController]
    [Route("[controller]")]
    public class WeatherForecastController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly MongoDBAccessor _accessor;

        public WeatherForecastController(MongoDBAccessor accessor)
        {
            _accessor = accessor;
        }

        [HttpGet]
        public IEnumerable&lt;WeatherForecast&gt; Get()
        {
            return _accessor.GetForecasts();
        }
    }
}
</code>
<p>
    To make the app not open the Swagger UI by default when running in development mode, we'll need to 
    edit the launch properties. The easiest way is to right click on the project's Properties folder 
    and click 'open.' Navigate to the Debug tab a find the Launch Browser option. Leave the box checked, 
    but clear the text input, that by default is set to 'swagger.'
</p>
<p>
    If you run the app now, the index.html page from the wwwroot folder will be opened in your browser as 
    expected, but you may be surprised to not see any data in the table. This is because the database is 
    empty. There are several options for populating the database, including manually inserting data via 
    the Mongo shell or creating a DatabaseSeeder class that adds data to the database only if none already exists, 
    but the best option is to add a new page to the project that lets users add new forecasts to the database. 
    We will implement this feature in part 2 of this article.

    In part 1 of this article, you've learned the advantages and drawbacks of using MongoDB for your 
    data storage needs, and how to implement MongoDB in a C# application. In Part 2, we'll
    upgrade the app to both create new forecasts and read existing ones.
