<h1>Anonymous Functions in 3 Languages</h1>

<h2>What are anonymous functions?</h2>
<p>
    An anonymous function does not have a specific name that identifies it. 
    Rather, it is passed around a program as a piece of data to be called 
    at later times. Anonymous functions are very handy when you need to 
    pass a unique function as an argument, as you can write the code for 
    it right in the parameter list of the other function you're calling 
    instead of having to break up your code. They can also be used to briefly 
    create a new scope without having to put that code in a totally different 
    place in your codebase.
</p>
<h2>How to make an anonymous functions in JavaScript</h2>
<p>
    JavaScript syntax offers two ways to create an anonymous function:
    <p>1: using the function keyword:</p>
<code>// creating a new scope by creating a function and calling it immediately
function() {
    // whatever your function needs to do
}() 

// Or, passed as a parameter:
setTimeout( function(){/* code to be run in 1500 seconds */}, 1500)
</code>
    <p>2: using arrow functions:</p>
<code>() => { // function body }()
</code>
    <p>Of course, these functions can accept parameters:</p>
<code>let desiredItems = array.filter( 
    (item) => { return item > 1}
    )
</code>
</p>
<h2>In C#</h2>
<p>
    C# also allows for two methods for generating anonymous functions:
    <p>1) using the delegate keyword:</p>
<code>List&lt;Item&gt; desiredItems = list.Where( 
    delegate(Item item) { return item.Name.length > 0; }
    );
</code>
    <p>2) lambda expressions:</p>
<code>List&lt;Item&gt; desiredItems = list.Where( 
    item => item.Name.length > 0   // the lambda expression
    );
</code>
</p>
<h2>In Python</h2>
<p>
    <p>Python has its own version of lambda expressions:</p>
<code>desired_items = list(map(
    lambda x: len(x.name) > 0 ,
    items_list))
</code>
    <p>These lambda functions can actually take any number of arguments:</p>
<code>argless_func = lambda : "Doesn't do much"
# argless_func() always just returns "Doesn't do much"

three_arg_func = lambda a, b, c : a*b + c  
# three_arg_func(2,3,4) will return 10
</code>
</p>

    In summary, that's five ways across three programming 
    languages to write anonymous functions. See if you can 
    use them to make your code a little more awesome!
