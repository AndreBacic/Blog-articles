<h2>What Is HTTP?</h2>
<p>
    HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a set of rules for how web servers 
    (like the ones Amazon and Google use to serve their websites) should respond 
    to requests from web browsers (like you, with Chrome or Firefox or whatever 
    browser you use). HTTP is the foundation for communication on the World Wide Web.
