<h1>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h1>

<h2>What Is HTTP?</h2>
<p>
    HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a set of rules for how web servers 
    (like the ones Amazon and Google use to serve their websites) should respond 
    to requests from web browsers (like you, with Chrome or Firefox or whatever 
    browser you use). HTTP is the foundation for communication on the World Wide Web.
</p>
<h2>What Do HTTP Conversations Look Like?</h2>
<p>
    First, a client sends a request to a web server. The web server then processes 
    the request and sends a response back to the client, completing the HTTP exchange.
</p>
<p>
    Both the request and the response contain important information in their <em>headers</em>, 
    and often after the headers include a <em>body</em>. The request headers will tell the 
    server if the client has any authentication credentials, what HTTP method (AKA <em>verb</em>) 
    the client is using, metadata about the body (if one is sent), and other relevant data about 
    the client. If a request includes a body, it is typically data that the client wishes the 
    server to store in a database. 
</p>
<p>
    The response headers will tell the client if the server was 
    able to successfully process the request (specifically, by returning a 3-digit <em>status code</em>), 
    details about the server and connection, and metadata about the response body. The body of a response 
    is the information the client requested, often a web page.

<h2>HTTP Verbs and Status Codes</h2>

<h2>What Is REST?</h2>
<p>Don't abuse HTTP verbs.</p>
