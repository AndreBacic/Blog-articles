<h1>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h1>

<h2>What Is HTTP?</h2>
<p>
    <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>t</strong>ext <strong>T</strong>ransfer 
    <strong>P</strong>rotocol (HTTP) is the underlying technology that allows web 
    servers (like the ones Amazon and Google use to serve their websites) to respond 
    to requests from web browsers (like you, with Chrome or Firefox or whichever 
    browser you use). In other words, HTTP is the foundation for communication on the World Wide Web.
</p>
<h2>What Do HTTP Conversations Look Like?</h2>
<p>
    First, a client sends a request to a web server. The web server then processes 
    the request and sends a response back to the client, completing the HTTP exchange.
</p>
<p>
    Both the request and the response contain important information in their <em>headers</em>, 
    and often after the headers include a <em>body</em>. The request headers will tell the 
    server if the client has any authentication credentials, what HTTP method (AKA <em>verb</em>) 
    the client is using, metadata about the body (if one is sent), and other relevant data about 
    the client. If a request includes a body, it is typically data that the client wishes the 
    server to store in a database. 
</p>
<p>
    The response headers will tell the client if the server was able to successfully process 
    the request (specifically, by returning a 3-digit <em>status code</em>), details about 
    the server and connection, and metadata about the response body (). The body of a response 
    is the information the client requested, often a web page.
</p>
<h2>HTTP Verbs and Status Codes</h2>
<p>
    In a request, the client uses HTTP verbs to ask a web server to perform specific actions.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0;">
    The most common verbs are: 
</p>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 1rem;">
    <li>GET : ask for data from the server.</li>
    <li>POST : send data to the server for storage.</li>
    <li>PUT : update data on the server.</li> 
    <li>DELETE : permanently remove data from the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    An HTTP response will always include a status code, which tells the client how the server 
    processed the request. Status codes are grouped into five categories, with the first digit 
    representing the category:
</p>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 1rem;">
    <li>
        <strong>1xx</strong> : informational messages, such as "Continue" or "Switching Protocols".
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>2xx</strong> : successful responses, such as "OK" or "Created".
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>3xx</strong> : redirections, such as "Moved Permanently" or "See Other".
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>4xx</strong> : client errors, such as "Bad Request" or "Unauthorized".
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>5xx</strong> : server errors, such as "Internal Server Error" or "Not Found".
    </li>
</ul>

    In summary, you have learned what Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is and how 
    clients and web servers use it to communicate. If you're developing web applications, 
    see if you can use your new knowledge to make your part of the internet a better place!
