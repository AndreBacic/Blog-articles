<h1>An Overview of Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h1>

<h2>What Is HTTP?</h2>
<p>
    <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>t</strong>ext <strong>T</strong>ransfer 
    <strong>P</strong>rotocol (HTTP) is the underlying technology that allows web 
    servers (like the ones Amazon and Google use to serve their websites) to respond 
    to requests from web browsers (like you, with Chrome or Firefox or whichever 
    browser you use). In other words, HTTP is the foundation for communication on the World Wide Web.
</p>
<h2>What Do HTTP Conversations Look Like?</h2>
<p>
    First, a client sends a request to a web server. The web server then processes 
    the request and sends a response back to the client, completing the HTTP exchange.
</p>
<p>
    Both the request and the response contain important information in their <em>headers</em>, 
    and often after the headers include a <em>body</em>. The request headers will tell the 
    server if the client has any authentication credentials, and also includes metadata 
    (information about information) about 
    the body (if one is sent), and other relevant data about the client. If a request includes a 
    body, it is typically data that the client wishes the server to store in a database. 
</p>
<p>
    The response headers will tell the client how the server processed
    the request, details about the server and connection, and metadata about the response body 
    (if one is sent). The body of a response is the information the client requested, often a web page.
</p>
<h2>HTTP Methods</h2>
<p>
    Let's now look at some specific HTTP information used in any request-response exchange.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0;">
    Firstly, in a request, the client uses HTTP methods to ask a web server to perform specific actions.
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0;">
    The most common methods are: 
</p>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 1rem;">
    <li>GET : ask for data from the server.</li>
    <li>POST : send data to the server for storage.</li>
    <li>PUT : update data on the server.</li> 
    <li>DELETE : permanently remove data from the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The HTTP methods are case-sensitive, so a client cannot send a 'get' request to a web server
    and receive a successful response.
</p>

<h2>HTTP Status Codes</h2>
<p>
    When the server replies with an HTTP response, the response will always include a status 
    code, which tells the client how the server processed the request. Status codes are grouped 
    into five categories, with the first digit representing the category:
</p>
<ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 1rem;">
    <li>
        <strong>1xx</strong> : informational messages, such as "Continue" or "Switching Protocols".
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>2xx</strong> : successful responses, such as "OK" or "Created".
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>3xx</strong> : redirections, such as "Moved Permanently" or "See Other".
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>4xx</strong> : client errors, such as "Bad Request" or "Unauthorized".
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>5xx</strong> : server errors, such as "Internal Server Error" or "Not Found".
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>An Example HTTP Conversation</h2>
<p>
    To put all this together, let's look at the HTTP request from your browser to get this article 
    and the HTTP response from the my blog's web server; first looking at the request:
</p>
<code>GET / HTTP/1.1

Host: andreblog.azurewebsites.net/article.html
Connection: keep-alive
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/6.0
</code>
<p>
    After specifying the HTTP method and protocol version, the client sends in the headers 
    the host name (url to the server and a specific webpage or API endpoint on it), connection 
    type, and the user agent (the browser). 
    The user agent shown here is actually Chrome, but it could be any browser. In POST or 
    other such methods, the client sends the data in the body, which would follow below the 
    headers. The headers would also include other metadata about the request, such as the 
    content type of the body.
</p>
<p>
    The server responds with:
</p>
<code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1163
Date: Wed, 06 Apr 2022 01:25:09 GMT
Server: Kestrel

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
...and the rest of the response body, which in this case is the webpage you're looking at.
</code>
<p>
    The server sends a 200 OK response, which means the request was successful and includes 
    the response body. The response headers include the content type and length of the response 
    body, the type of server that sent the information, and the time the response was sent (the 
    example given is when I was writing this article, but the response your computer received 
    had the present time in the Greenwich Mean Time time zone).
</p>
<p>
    Once your browser received the response, the HTTP conversation was over and your browser turned to 
    applying CSS styles and running some JavaScript code, but that's information for another article. 
</p>

    In summary, you have learned what Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is and how 
    clients and web servers use it to communicate. If you're developing web applications, 
    see if you can use your new knowledge to make your part of the internet a better place!
