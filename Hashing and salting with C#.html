<h1>Hashing and Salting in C#</h1>

<h2>What is Hashing? What is Salting?</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1px;">
    Hashing, in general, is a method of computing a unique value for a given piece of data. 
    Hashing is often used to convert a string of characters into a number. In cryptography, 
    hashing is used to encrypt data, like a password, so that it cannot be decrypted. Instead, 
    when a user enters a password, it is hashed and compared with the password hash stored in the database.

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1px;">
    Salting is a way to add a random string to the end of a password before the password is hashed. 
    Not only does this make it harder to guess the password if attackers gain access to the hash, but 
    because each user gets a different salt multiple users can have the same password, but each resulting 
    hash is unique.

    Next, we'll look at two algorithm for generating secure hashes.

<h2>PBKDF2 in C#</h2>
<p>
    <!-- TODO: Verify that the GitHub Copilot-generated paragraphs are accurate -->
    PBKDF2 is a key derivation function that is used to derive keys from passwords. It works by 
    iterating a hash function over a password and a salt. The iteration count is controlled by the 
    cost parameter. The iteration count is the number of times the hash function is applied to the 
    password and salt. The iteration count is also called the number of rounds. Here is an example 
    of how to use PBKDF2 in C#:
</p>
<code>using System;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Text;

string password = "password123";
// Create a cryptographically strong salt
byte[] salt = new byte[16];
using (RNGCryptoServiceProvider rng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider())
{
    rng.GetBytes(salt);
}        
int iterations = 10000;
// desired key length can be changed to any value, but it should be at least as long as the hash function's output size.
int keyLength = 256;

// Create a password hash
byte[] hash = PBKDF2(password, salt, iterations, keyLength);
</code>
<p>
    The PBKDF2 function is used to derive a key (synonymous with 'hash' in this case) from a password. 
    The function takes a password, a salt, 
    a number of iterations, and a key length. The function returns a key of the desired length. When a 
    user enters a password attempt, the function is called again with the same salt, iterations, and 
    key length. If the new key is the same as the one generated by the first call, the password is correct.
</p>

<h2>BCrypt in C#</h2>
<p>
    BCrypt is a password hashing algorithm that is designed to be slow but secure. It is a combination 
    of a hashing algorithm and a key derivation function. The hashing algorithm is designed to be 
    computationally expensive, but the key derivation function is designed to be computationally 
    cheap. Here is an example of how to use BCrypt in C#:
