<h1>Hashing and Salting in C#</h1>

<h2>What is Hashing? What is Salting?</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 2px;">
    Hashing, in general, is a method of computing a unique value for a given piece of data. 
    Hashing is often used to convert a string of characters into a number. In cryptography, 
    hashing is used to encrypt data, like a password, such that any given input produces a 
    unique, fixed-length output that cannot be decrypted. Instead, when a user tries to log 
    in to an app by entering a password, the password attempt is hashed and compared with the 
    password hash stored in the database. If the hashes match, the user can log in.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 2px;">
    Salting is a way to add a random string to the end of a password before the password is hashed. 
    Not only does this make it harder to guess the password if attackers gain access to the hash, but 
    because each salt is different multiple users can have the same password while each resulting 
    hash is unique. 
</p>
<p>
    But why bother hashing passwords, and adding salts to make them even harder to crack? Sometimes, 
    attackers are able to gain access to an app's database and read all the information stored in it. 
    Because users usually use the same password across many applications, letting attackers read or crack passwords quickly 
    doesn't allow users any time to update their passwords if you suffer a security breach. While all hashing 
    algorithms can be cracked with brute force eventually, employing optimized algorithms can stretch the time 
    it takes to crack a set of hashed passwords to months or years, and in some cases to the maximum lifetime of the universe. 
    Now that we've covered what hashing is, we'll look at two algorithm for generating secure hashes.

<h2>PBKDF2 in C#</h2>
<p>
    PBKDF2 is a key derivation function recommended by 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/data-protection/consumer-apis/password-hashing" 
    target="_blank">the Microsoft C# docs</a>. It works by taking in a password and salt and then hashes 
    them a certain number of iterations with a specified hashing function. The first iteration combines 
    the password and salt and hashes them. Each following iteration, the hash from the previous iteration is 
    put through the same hashing function to extend the chain of irreversible encrypting. 
    Here is an example of how to use PBKDF2 in C#:
</p>
<code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cryptography.KeyDerivation;
using System.Security.Cryptography;

string password = "Password123";  // Please use more secure passwords than this in real life.

// Create a cryptographically strong salt
byte[] salt = new byte[32];
using (RNGCryptoServiceProvider rng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider())
{
    rng.GetBytes(salt);
}

byte[] hash = KeyDerivation.Pbkdf2(
        password: password,
        salt: salt,
        prf: KeyDerivationPrf.HMACSHA512,
        iterationCount: 100000,
        numBytesRequested: 64);
</code>
<p style="margin-bottom: 1px;">
    First, the salt is created with RNGCryptoServiceProvider, a cryptographic random number generator. 
    Then, the password and salt are hashed using SHA-512 (SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm, and 
    512 is the number of output bits of the function), which was designed by the US National Security Agency. 
</p>
<p>
    Since SHA-512 can be computed fairly quickly by modern computers, as many 100,000 iterations are necessary to slow 
    down attackers if they gain access to the database. Computers get faster every year, so it is 
    recommended to regularly increase the iteration count in your code. When a user enters a password attempt, 
    the function is called again with the same salt, iterations, and output bytes. If the new 
    hash is the same as the one generated by the first call, the password is correct.
</p>

<h2>Argon2 in C#</h2>
<p>
    Argon2 is a more recent password hashing algorithm, and was the winner of the Password Hashing 
    Competition (PHC) in 2015. It accounts for parallelism, memory usage, and other factors that make 
    it more effective than preceding algorithms. Argon2 comes in three versions: Argon2d, Argon2i, and 
    Argon2id, which uses the previous two together. Here is an example of how to use Argon2 in C#:
</p>
<code>using Konscious.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Text;

string password = "Password123";

// Create a cryptographically strong salt
byte[] salt = new byte[32];
using (RNGCryptoServiceProvider rng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider())
{
    rng.GetBytes(salt);
}

byte[] hash = new byte[64];
using (var argon2id = new Argon2id(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(password)))
{
    argon2id.Salt = salt;
    argon2id.Iterations = 10;
    argon2id.MemorySize = 65536; // 2^16KiB = 64MiB
    argon2id.DegreeOfParallelism = 8;

    hash = argon2id.GetBytes(64);
}
</code>
<p>
    Argon2's extra security measures require not only more resources to compute the hash, but 
    significantly more time. Thus, 10 iterations is more than enough to slow down would-be password crackers.
